Documentation checked: ```README.md``` ```docs```

Feedback:

*“I really like how the README immediately tells me what the app is, why it exists, and who it’s for. Code, documentation, and requirements are clearly laid out and easy to follow. One enhancement could be adding a “Documentation” link or table of contents directly in the README so users don’t have to hunt around for the docs folder. Also, since the app embraces a playful, colourful interface, giving the README a bit more personality with emojis, styled headings or use the ASCII banner as the title in the README could make it fit more with the app’s tone. Because the app handles user accounts and passwords, iI would like to see a brief statement about this in the README, a security statement. Something that outlines how passwords and my data would be securely stored and not shared. This would strengthen trust for any would-be user. Enhance the app to match professional standards around security and user privacy seen in the real-world. Overall, the foundation is strong and these tweaks would raise usability and trust even further.”*

Actions taken:

1. Added a direct link in ```README``` to ```docs``` folder to guide user to help files, improve usability and accessibility.

Feedback:

*“Your readme looks great! Gives me a clear picture on your features, who its intended for and a brief that explains the differences to your product and others. I would recommend: 1. expand a little further on the features that makes your product stand out against the competitors. This would be the key sales pitch that piques potential clients into buying into your product. 2. Add the more operational information in your readme. Users would need to understand how to setup their environments, how to install any dependencies to use your products, and how to launch said product”*

Documentation checked: ```README.md```

Feedback:

*“Looks really clean! I really like the visual appeal with the terminal screenshot doubling as a title for the readme. One thing I would suggest to consider is putting a simplified install/setup section straight into the main README. you have linked your documents well, but having quick copy-paste steps on the front page makes it super accessible for users who just want to get started right away without having to delve into the full documentation”*

Actions taken:

1. Added a simplified installation section to ```README```. Users can quickly copy-paste to launch the app.
