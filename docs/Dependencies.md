**Purpose of Each Dependency**
   - **bcrypt:** Provides secure password hashing to protect user data.
   - **emoji:** Display emojis in the CLI for a fun user experience.
   - **rich:** Enhances CLI with style, colours, task table and formatting for better readability.
   - **pyfiglet:** Creates ASCII art banners to make the app pop! Visually engaging and fun.
   - **markdown-it-py, mdurl, Pygments:** Support rich text rendering and syntax highlighting used by `rich`.
   - **six:** Ensures compatibility between Python 2 and 3, used by `bcrypt`.

**Legal & Ethical Impacts**  
   - All files are created and managed by the app, no external dependencies or third-party code.
   - User data stays local and is stored securely in JSON format.
   - Only reputable open source libraries are used (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD licenses).
   - No restrictive or copyleft licensesâ€”safe for personal or project use and distribution.
   - No external data sharing or tracking.

- **Security Impact** 
   - User passwords are hashed (never stored as plain text).
   - All user data is stored locally and no personal data is shared externally.
   - The app has no internet connectivity requirements, further ensuring data privacy.

- **Conflicts**
   - These packages are known to be fully compatible with each other, with no conflicting versions or installation issues on the specified versions.
   - Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. Pinning versions in `requirements.txt` preserves compatibility, preventing future issues with updates.
