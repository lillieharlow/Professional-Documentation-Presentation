# TO DO. CLI App

TO DO. is a fun, secure, and easy-to-use task management app that runs directly in your terminal.
Unlike typical plain-text CLI tools, TO DO. brings your productivity to life with emoji, colour, and ASCII art banners — making task management engaging and stress-free.

In today’s world of productivity apps, many solutions are either overly complex (e.g., Notion, Trello) or too minimal (simple text files or todo.txt). TO DO. addresses this gap by providing:
* A lightweight and accessible tool you can use directly in the terminal.

* A secure environment with hashed passwords and JSON-based storage.

* An engaging user experience, so managing your tasks doesn’t feel like a chore.

Command line tools are still one of the fastest ways to get work done, especially for developers. They use minimal resources and fit right into existing workflows [1]. At the same time, studies show that good design, like clear visuals and easy-to-use interfaces  keeps people coming back to an app [2].

TO DO. adds colour, ASCII banners, and emojis to make managing tasks in the terminal more fun and engaging.

## Features

* Colourful CLI - emoji and ASCII art for an engaging experience.

* Secure login system - user data stored in JSON, passwords hashed with bcrypt.

* Guest mode - try before signing up (tasks aren’t saved in guest mode).

* Task management - add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

* Prioritisation - organise tasks with High, Medium, or Low priority levels.

* Persistent storage - your tasks are saved and ready when you return.
